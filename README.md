# Airfn Web App

Airfn Web App is a supplement to **Airfn CLI** where users can view metrics and logs of their deployed Lambdas instantly without navigating through AWS’s plethora of services for easier debugging and management of their Lambda functions.

Users can look at individual functions to see function source code and logs for debugging purposes.

## Setup

* User can sign up and log into his account with mutli-factor authentication options on the Web App through AWS’ authorization service, AWS Cognito.

* User can see an overview of his functions and inspect each function’s source code and logs.

* User can see metrics associated with their functions, including the number of invocations and the number of errors.
